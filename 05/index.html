                   <p>Hannah Arendt was a political theorist and philosopher of the 20th century. Born and raised in the former German Empire in 1906, she landed in America in the 1930's, fleeing the rise of Adolf Hitler. In America, her career flourished, and her seminal work which elevated her academic fame was published in 1958, titled The Human Condition. In it, she examined the dinstinctions between Vita Activa (Active Life) and Vita Contemplativa (Life of Contemplation) and noted that the modern world had elevated Vita Activa above Vita Contemplativa, reversing the hierarchy of the past two millenniums held through Platonic and Christian ideas. Despite this reversal, which she noted to be a positive transformation, she further deduced the Vita Activa into three categories of labour, work and action. She understood labour as feeding our basic necessities, work as durable objects crafted by humans and marked by its key characteristic of instrumentality, and action as the distinctly human means by which we disclose ourselves to others. Just as the Classical Period had held action within Vita Activa as the highest standard to accord ourselves towards, she too believed in this orientation towards action. She critiqued the modern world for reversing this hierarchy within the Vita Activa, elevating labour and its notions of necessesity such as consumption over all others.
